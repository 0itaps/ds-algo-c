# Data Structures and Algorithms in C

This repository contains foundational implementations of core data structures and algorithms, written in C. All code is implemented from scratch without relying on standard libraries, with a focus on low-level memory handling, pointers, and algorithmic thinking.

## Topics Covered

- Arrays and Recursion
- Linked Lists and Pointers
- Searching and Sorting
- Stacks and Queues
- Hash Tables and Sets
- Binary Trees and Balanced Trees
- Heaps and Priority Queues
- Graphs and Traversals

## Project Structure

Each directory contains:
- One or more `.c` files with relevant implementations

## How to Compile

Use the terminal to compile and run any file: 
`gcc filename.c -o filename ./filename`


## Purpose

This project is part of a personal summer learning plan to strengthen core programming and computer science fundamentals through hands-on coding in C.
